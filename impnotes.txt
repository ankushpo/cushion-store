The STATICFILES_DIRS tuple tells Django where to look for static files that are not tied to a particular app. In this case,
we just told Django to also look for static files in a folder called static in our root folder, not just in our apps.

Django also provides a mechanism for collecting static files into one place so that they can be served easily.
Using the collectstatic command, Django looks for all static files in your apps and collects them wherever you told it to,
i.e. the STATIC_ROOT. In our case, we are telling Django that when we run python manage.py collectstatic,
gather all static files into a folder called staticfiles in our project root directory.
This feature is very handy for serving static files, especially in production settings.
